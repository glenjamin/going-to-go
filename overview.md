Me

Dev for a long time

Know a bunch of languages

Production use:
  - JS
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - NodeJS

I learnt go a while ago, can't remember exactly but I have some commits in terraform in Sept 2015

But never really did anything with it

Now I work for CircleCI, and we have some go, so I need to learn it properly.

Speedbumps:
 - build tooling
 - modules
 - file/package mismatch

 But these all seemed like me and go having different philosophies

 But one thing I've always seen that seems quite un-go-like:

And specifically `append`
