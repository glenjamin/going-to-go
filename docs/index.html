                      <p>When working on a variety of different projects, I want to declare and use the same versions of tools as everyone else, just in case there are compatibility issues.</p>

      <p>Back when I did that terraform work, there was a Makefile that wrapped a bunch of stuff that just worked somehow - I never looked into it much</p>

      <p>Since then the ecosystem has churned a few times and very recently settled on an approach which works, but isn't as seamless as NodeJS or Clojure, and many go projects still recommend binary installs via system package managers or curling shell scripts.</p>

                      <p>When go says simple, it means keeping the language simple.</p>

                      <p>These are all really down to the Go Way</p>

      <p>Like "how do I do default arguments"</p>

      <p>Or "how do I assert in tests"</p>

      <p>Two aspects here, Go likes to have its own way of doing things, and it's not always easy to find their reasons behind that</p>

      <p>But also, go has a lot of fans, and there seems to be a habit of espousing the go way even if they don't know the reasons. Which can also lead to not trying out alternatives if the go core team isn't doing it.</p>

                      <p>All of the above things generally come down to this</p>

      <p>And a talk all about how me and go have different philosophies didn't seem very productive</p>

                      <p>But then I found something that didn't seem very go-like at all</p>

      <p>I suggested to Daniel that go should either always mutate, and not return</p>

      <p>Or always copy, or at least give us a built-in copy function?</p>
